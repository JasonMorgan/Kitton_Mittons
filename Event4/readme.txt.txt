Entry 4 Monitoring tools

This entry consists of 3 main files:
AuditConfig.ps1
DeployConfig.ps1
Monitoring.psm1

An install is included to ensure that the Module Manifest and required formatting files are included when the module is used.

The transcripts cover the module import, deployment, and audit in action.

The advantage of providing a module file with detailed help is we expect the user to be able to augment the basic functionality in the scripts with the more granular control provided by the functions.

Please be careful if using the Uninstall.ps1 file.  The Impact level is defined as high but it does delete files, be sure you understand what it is doing before you run it.

Thank you,
The Kitton Mittons
