Feel free to comment but I'll only open this to contributions from Team Members.  If you are interested in joining the Kitton Mittons team please email me @ jmorgan@f9vs.com, or sed me a message on twitter @RJasonMorgan.

Just a quick note, if you are on another team and you need want to use any of our material please make a note in your script that you got it from us.  We're happy to share as long as we get credit for our work.
